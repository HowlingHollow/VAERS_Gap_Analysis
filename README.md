# VAERS 2021 & 2022 Gap Analysis

Last Updated: March 3rd, 2024

### Focus and Scope
- Determine the current state of completeness and accuracy of the VAERS database during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
- Analyze possible correlations of missing and outlying reports with other attributes in the dataset:
    -  Geographic & Demographic Information.
    -  Length & desnity of medical terminology within free-text symptom descriptions.
- Determine whether incomplete & unreliable reports strongly correlate with increased news reporting on mRNA & COVID Vaccines.
- If analysis shows the need, use the insights gained to develop criteria for a reporting system that is more robust and reliable during times of heightened public awareness.

## Please Understand the Data, its Nature, and Limitations Before Coming to Any Conclusions Based on This Project!
#### Understand what VAERS is:

#### Understand the Proper Way to Interpret the Data:

#### Read the Project Documentation and CDC Data Use Guide included in this project. The main points are:
- The VAERS dataset is not comprehensive. Underreporting is a core limitation of all passive reporting systems.
- It is not verifiable or reliable. Due to restrictions on personal health information, the public dataset is completely anonymized.
- **Correlation does not equal Causation:** Nothing in the dataset or this project can prove any link between adverse reations or symptoms and a vaccine or its manufacturer.
#### The original archived dataset can be found at:

- The Data Use Guides and other CDC Resources are also included in this project.
